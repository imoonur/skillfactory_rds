SkillFactory RDS Project 2

The essence of the project is to track the impact of living conditions of students aged 15 to 22 on their performance in mathematics in order to identify students at an early stage at risk.
This can be done using a model that would predict the results of the state exam in mathematics for each student of the school. To determine the parameters of the future model, it is necessary to conduct an exploratory analysis of the data and draw up a report on its results.

The CSV file contains a variety of student data that can potentially affect their final math score and the value of their final score. The file contains data on 395 students with 30 features for them.

Stages of work on the project:
    - data preprocessing (cleaning, transformation);
    - a brief analysis of each of the variables with intermediate conclusions;
    - correlation analysis of quantitative variables and analysis of the significance of categorical variables;
    - selection of significant variables for building a model;
    - formulation of final conclusions.

Self-reflection things:
    1. Dedicated a lot of time to the project and completed it myself.
    2. Especially pleased with the results of the statistical analysis.
    3. It is worth working on spending less time on the project.
    4. Learned a wide range of statistics applications.
    5. The main result of the project is the consolidation of theoretical knowledge with a real practical EDA.
    6. I use EDA in my current job.
    7. I believe that additional study of materials is a continuous and integral process in the course of modern solution of applied problems.
